<objective>
Create the Feature Grid section with 6 accessible, animated feature cards in a responsive bento layout.

Purpose: Showcase Omni's key features (Rewards on Tuition, Zero School Fees, Pay Over Time, Bank-Level Security, Real-Time Tracking, Smart Underwriting) with visual polish and full keyboard accessibility.

Output: FeatureCard and FeatureGrid components ready for page integration.

  <name>Task 1: Create FeatureCard component with hover and focus states</name>
  <files>
    components/content-sections/feature-grid/feature-card.tsx
    lib/animation-variants.ts
  </files>
  <action>
Create `components/content-sections/feature-grid/feature-card.tsx`:

1. 'use client' directive (motion requires client)

2. Interface FeatureCardProps:
   - title: string
   - description: string
   - icon: React.ReactNode (lucide icon)
   - className?: string (for grid span variants)

3. FeatureCard component:
   - Use motion.article (semantic HTML for feature card)
   - Apply existing cardHoverVariants from animation-variants.ts
   - initial="rest", whileHover="hover", whileFocus="hover" (same animation on keyboard focus)
   - transition={cardTransition}
   - tabIndex={0} for keyboard focus
   - role="article" with aria-labelledby pointing to title id
   - Classes: bg-card rounded-xl p-8 shadow-md border border-border/50 cursor-default outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-primary focus-visible:ring-offset-2
   - style={{ willChange: 'transform' }} for GPU acceleration
   - Icon wrapper: div with text-primary mb-4, icon receives size-8
   - Title: h3 with font-display text-lg font-semibold mb-2, unique id for aria
   - Description: p with text-muted-foreground text-sm leading-relaxed

4. Add icon animation variant to lib/animation-variants.ts:
```typescript
export const iconHoverVariants = {
  rest: { scale: 1, rotate: 0 },
  hover: { scale: 1.1, rotate: -5 },
}
```

5. Wrap icon in motion.div with iconHoverVariants, initial="rest", variants inherited from parent (use whileHover="hover" on parent triggers child)

Pattern reference: MetricCards uses cardHoverVariants successfully - extend with focus states.

    - TypeScript compiles: `npx tsc --noEmit`
    - File exists: `ls components/content-sections/feature-grid/feature-card.tsx`
    - Imports cardHoverVariants: `grep -l "cardHoverVariants" components/content-sections/feature-grid/feature-card.tsx`
  </verify>
  <done>
    - FeatureCard component exists with hover lift animation
    - Keyboard focus triggers same hover animation (whileFocus="hover")
    - Focus ring visible via focus-visible:ring-2
    - Icon animates on hover (scale + slight rotation)
  </done>

  <name>Task 2: Create FeatureGrid with 6 cards in responsive bento layout</name>
  <files>
    components/content-sections/feature-grid/feature-grid.tsx
    components/content-sections/feature-grid/index.ts
  </files>
  <action>
Create `components/content-sections/feature-grid/feature-grid.tsx`:

1. 'use client' directive

2. Import icons from lucide-react:
   - Gift (Rewards on Tuition)
   - Building2 (Zero School Fees)
   - Clock (Pay Over Time)
   - Shield (Bank-Level Security)
   - Activity (Real-Time Tracking)
   - Brain (Smart Underwriting)

3. Define features array with 6 items:
```typescript
const features = [
  {
    icon: Gift,
    title: 'Rewards on Tuition',
    description: 'Earn cash back every time you pay tuition. Up to 1% back on qualifying payments.',
  },
  {
    icon: Building2,
    title: 'Zero School Fees',
    description: 'Schools pay nothing. Omni covers all processing costs so institutions can focus on education.',
  },
  {
    icon: Clock,
    title: 'Pay Over Time',
    description: 'Flexible payment plans that fit your budget. No hidden fees, no surprises.',
  },
  {
    icon: Shield,
    title: 'Bank-Level Security',
    description: 'Your data is protected with enterprise-grade encryption and fraud monitoring.',
  },
  {
    icon: Activity,
    title: 'Real-Time Tracking',
    description: 'Monitor your payments, rewards, and spending from a single dashboard.',
  },
  {
    icon: Brain,
    title: 'Smart Underwriting',
    description: 'Our AI-powered system offers personalized rates based on your complete financial picture.',
  },
]
```

4. FeatureGrid component:
   - Wrap in section with id="features" for nav scrolling
   - Container: max-w-6xl mx-auto px-4 py-20 sm:py-24
   - Section header: ScrollReveal with text-center mb-12
     - h2: font-display text-3xl sm:text-4xl font-bold mb-4 "Why Omni?"
     - p: text-muted-foreground text-lg max-w-2xl mx-auto
   - Grid container with staggerContainerVariants:
     - Classes: grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6
     - Use motion.div with variants={staggerContainerVariants}, initial="hidden", whileInView="visible", viewport={{ once: true, amount: 0.2 }}
   - Map features, render FeatureCard with slideUpVariants on each
   - Each card wrapped in motion.div with variants={slideUpVariants}

5. Create `components/content-sections/feature-grid/index.ts`:
```typescript
export { FeatureGrid } from './feature-grid'
export { FeatureCard } from './feature-card'
```

Grid is standard 3-column on large screens for even feature importance. All 6 cards equal size.
  </action>
  <verify>
    - TypeScript compiles: `npx tsc --noEmit`
    - File exists: `ls components/content-sections/feature-grid/feature-grid.tsx`
    - Grid uses stagger: `grep -l "staggerContainerVariants" components/content-sections/feature-grid/feature-grid.tsx`
    - 6 features defined: `grep -c "title:" components/content-sections/feature-grid/feature-grid.tsx` returns 6
  </verify>
  <done>
    - FeatureGrid renders 6 FeatureCards
    - Responsive layout: 1 col mobile, 2 col tablet, 3 col desktop
    - Cards stagger animate on scroll into view
    - Section has id="features" for nav anchor
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. TypeScript compiles without errors: `npx tsc --noEmit`
2. Both files exist and export correctly
3. Cards use established animation patterns from animation-variants.ts
4. Keyboard accessibility: tabIndex, focus-visible ring, whileFocus
5. Semantic HTML: article, h3 with id, aria-labelledby
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- 6 feature cards render in responsive grid
- Cards lift on hover with smooth animation
- Cards have visible focus ring on keyboard focus
- Icons animate (scale + rotate) on hover
- Stagger animation plays when section scrolls into view
- Component exports ready for page integration
</success_criteria>
