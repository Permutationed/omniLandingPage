# Plan 07.2-01: Remove Storyset Illustrations & Restore Refined Isometric Shapes

## Objective

Remove the childish Storyset illustrations that contain cartoon characters and playful decorations. Replace with clean, geometric isometric building shapes that match fintech aesthetic.

## Why This Matters

The Storyset "Online Transactions" and "College Campus" illustrations contain:
- Cartoon characters with exaggerated features
- Colorful decorative plants and elements
- Consumer-app aesthetic inappropriate for fintech

This is the #1 reason the site feels "childish" compared to Bilt, Ramp, Mercury.

## Tasks

<task id="1">
Delete Storyset illustration files

```bash
rm -rf public/illustrations/buildings/
```

Verify: `ls public/illustrations/` shows no buildings directory
</task>

<task id="2">
Restore IsometricBank component with refined geometric SVG

Replace the Next.js Image component with a clean, geometric isometric bank building SVG.

Design principles:
- Monochromatic or limited color (use ISO_COLORS)
- Clean geometric shapes (no decorations)
- Professional isometric projection
- Subtle gradients for depth

The SVG should:
- Have a classical bank facade (columns, pediment)
- Use ISO_COLORS.surfaceLeft, surfaceRight, surfaceTop for 3D faces
- Include subtle shadow ellipse
- Keep "Your Bank" label

File: `components/how-you-earn/tuition-rewards/isometric-bank.tsx`

Preserve existing animation pattern:
```typescript
const opacity = useTransform(progress, fadeInRange, [0, 1])
const y = useTransform(progress, fadeInRange, [20, 0])
```
</task>

<task id="3">
Restore IsometricSchool component with refined geometric SVG

Create a clean, geometric isometric university building.

Design principles:
- Central tower with spire (classic university look)
- Grid of isometric window parallelograms
- Entrance with steps
- Flag on tower
- Use ISO_COLORS for all faces

File: `components/how-you-earn/tuition-rewards/isometric-school.tsx`

Preserve:
- Animation pattern (opacity, y transforms)
- Checkmark badge overlay with its own animation
- "Your School" label
</task>

<task id="4">
Restore CampusBuilding component with refined geometric SVG

Create a smaller, simpler isometric campus building for the map center.

Design principles:
- Simpler than university (fewer details)
- Tower with spire
- Window grid
- Clean geometric shapes

File: `components/how-you-earn/discover-rewards/campus-building.tsx`

Preserve:
- Animation pattern (opacity, scale transforms)
- Absolute positioning for map center
- "Campus" badge with color-mix styling
</task>

<task id="5">
Update ISO_COLORS if needed for more refined palette

Review `components/how-you-earn/shared/constants.ts`

Consider adjustments:
- Slightly reduce saturation on primary colors
- Ensure surface colors create proper depth
- Keep consistent with main design system

Only make changes if current colors create visual issues.
</task>

<task id="6">
Verify visual output

```bash
npm run build
```

Manual verification:
- [ ] Bank building appears as clean geometric shape
- [ ] School building appears as clean geometric shape with checkmark
- [ ] Campus building centered on map
- [ ] No cartoon characters or playful elements visible
- [ ] Scroll animations still work
- [ ] Responsive sizing maintained
</task>

## Verification Criteria

- [ ] No files exist in `public/illustrations/buildings/`
- [ ] IsometricBank renders clean geometric SVG
- [ ] IsometricSchool renders clean geometric SVG with checkmark overlay
- [ ] CampusBuilding renders clean geometric SVG
- [ ] All scroll-linked animations work (opacity, y, scale)
- [ ] `npm run build` passes
- [ ] Visual output matches fintech aesthetic (not childish)

## must_haves (Goal-Backward)

For Phase 7.2 goal "Professional fintech aesthetic":
- [ ] Buildings are geometric, not cartoon
- [ ] No decorative elements (plants, characters)
- [ ] Colors are sophisticated (from ISO_COLORS)
- [ ] Maintains existing animation system
